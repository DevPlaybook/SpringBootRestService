# SpringBootRestService
This code goes with the Dev Playbook on how to build a REST web service in Java with Spring Boot.

For this Playbook, we create a very simple REST web service that has one GET request action that returns the meaning of a name, if the service knows it.

Note that we're just hard-coding the logic as opposed wiring up a database. We'll cover that in a future Playbook.

For a short video and step-by-step walk-thru as well as tips, tricks, and online resources, visit the [Playbook](https://devplaybook.com/2018/01/27/build-a-rest-web-service-in-java-with-spring-boot/) here.
